this is where I am putting all of my rough code

test1, test2, test3, test4, test5 are my inital simulation of the maze exploration logic for a single robot

test6 shows that my logic does not misbehave after 2000000 cycles. does not prove much I would need to do more testing to say that it works conclusively.
itt works well enough for me to move on
